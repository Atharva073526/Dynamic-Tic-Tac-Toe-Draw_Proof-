# Dynamic Tic-Tac-Toe Draw_Proof

<h3>About</h3>
Getting a Tie in Tic-Tac-Toe game is really annoying. Ever thought of getting rid of it? Well the code does exactly that, this is a dynamic Tic-Tac-Toe game made using C-language. The game will go on until one of the player eventually win, no matter how long it takes.

<h3>How it works: </h3>

<h4>Concepts used </h4>
Functions<br>
Loops<br>
Arrays<br>
Global variables<br>
Decision control statements<br>

<h4>Game Logic</h4>
If a player (say x) creates a winning pattern he win.
But if a win isn't achieved, the game will automatically get rid of the oldest mark placed by the player keeping only 2 of his marks on the board.
This will continue until someone successfully forms a winning patter.

Unlike traditional Tic-Tac-Toe which often ends in a tie, this version forces the players to think ahead, since old moves vanish â€” keeping the game fresh, strategic, and never ending in a draw.
